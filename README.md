### 💬 Exploring How AI Can Bring Light to Human Emotions..

I am an AI researcher and developer 👩‍💻 driven by the vision of creating artificial intelligence that can understand human emotions 🥰 — not just to analyze them, but to comfort 🤗, encourage 🌈, and inspire 💡.

My ultimate goal is to design empathetic AI systems that bring positive influence to the world 🌍, making technology a source of healing 🌱 and joy 😄 rather than distance.

With strong communication skills 🗣️ and a deep appreciation for well-structured processes 🧩, I thrive on bridging ideas into actionable solutions 🔗.  

At the same time, I enjoy exploring diverse and creative experiments 💻, constantly seeking innovative ways to combine technical rigor with human-centered impact ❤️.
